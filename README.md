## Getting Started

First, let's create the project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest name-of-app
```
Then Follow the prompts:

TypeScript: Yes or No (your choice)
ESLint: Yes
Tailwind CSS: Optional (we can add it later if needed)
src directory: Yes (recommended)
App Router: Yes (recommended)


```bash
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
